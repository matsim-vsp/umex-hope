# umex-hope

This repository contains out contribution to the umex-hope consortium (https://zkfn.de/umex-hope/). _Disclaimer:_ We are in the **very** early stages of building this library. At this point in time, we do not recommend using this for anything.
The goal of this work is two-fold:

1. Read MATSim output files into Julia and prepare them for data analysis and modeling workflows
2. Build a agent-based model in Julia based on the output files from 1.

## Process an event file

## Read in a population file 

## Read in facilities

## Read in a network

## Read in plans

## Read in experienced plans
